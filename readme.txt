This Day in History I wanted a more in depth "This Day in History" archive rather than the stock calendar.history file that ships with my distro. So when i found the CDAY Calendar Almanac and proceeded to do just that. http://cday.sourceforge.net/ This archive has been "translated" to work with $calendar in most Linux/BSD based systems... not too sure how many it'll work on.

just save the file and call with the -f flag in calendar to the path you saved the file. and the rest is this day in history. $calendar -f /path/to/calendar.event -A 0

A big thanks to the Admin at CDAY, Patrick Kincaid and Bruce T. Goldman
